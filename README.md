# Machine-Learning-Projects
A collection of projects that I've worked on in data science. 

#### Algorithms Include:

Machine learning: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K Means Clustering, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, 

#### Convolutional Neural Network: 

Used for predicting a species through labeled image data. The program takes in an input image, assigns importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The structure of nodes/neurons is modelled after the brain. 

3 Covolutional layers are used for improved performance, flattening techniques are used as well. It is a feedforward CNN, and through training, the errors are backpropagated and weights are continually adjusted. 

#### Lending Club Data Set: 

LendingClub.com is a website that conects borrowers with investors. I created models that help predict profiles that have a high           probability of paying investors back.

#### UCI Vertebral Column Data Set:

In this project, I use Decision Trees and Random Forests as a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a spinal condition called Kyphosis is present or absent after a corrective surgery.

#### Advertising Website Data Set: 

In this project I worked with an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.  The dataset is based off of features such as 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Daily Internet Usage', and more.

#### UCI Breast Cancer Data Set:

In this project, I explore Machine Learning on the breast cancer data set from scikit learn. The final SVC model helps to predict with high accuracy of our target class (binary classification) of whether there is presence of a benign or malignant tumor.

#### UCI Iris Flower Species Data Set:

In this Project, I explore SVM algorithms to separate and classifies the species based on certain features.
