# Machine-Learning-Projects
A collection of projects that I've worked on in data science. 

#### Algorithms Include:

Supervised learning methods: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K Means Clustering, K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, 



#### Lending Club Data Set: 

LendingClub.com is a website that conects borrowers with investors. I created models that help predict profiles that have a high           probability of paying investors back.

#### UCI Vertebral Column Data Set:

In this project, I use Decision Trees and Random Forests as a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a spinal condition called Kyphosis is present or absent after a corrective surgery.

#### Advertising Website Data Set: 

In this project I worked with an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.  The dataset is based off of features such as 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Daily Internet Usage', and more.

#### UCI Breast Cancer Data Set:

In this project, I explore Machine Learning on the breast cancer data set from scikit learn. The final SVC model helps to predict with high accuracy of our target class (binary classification) of whether there is presence of a benign or malignant tumor.

#### UCI Iris Flower Species Data Set:

In this Project, I explore SVM algorithms to separate and classifies the species based on certain features.
